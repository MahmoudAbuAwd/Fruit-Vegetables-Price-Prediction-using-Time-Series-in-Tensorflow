# Fruit & Vegetables Price Prediction using Time Series in TensorFlow

## Overview
This project aims to predict the future prices of fruits and vegetables using a time series model built with **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** networks. The GRU model is designed to capture the sequential dependencies in historical price data, allowing for accurate predictions of future trends. The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function, with early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for model development.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning library used to build and train the GRU model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for building neural networks (part of TensorFlow).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing model performance and results.
